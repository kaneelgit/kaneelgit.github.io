            Hi! Thank you for visiting my website. My  
              name is Kaneel. I am a recent graduate with 
            a master's degree from the University of Delaware. I am originally from <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" target = "_blank"> Sri Lanka </a> and 
            currently I am living in Newark, Delaware. <br> <br>
            During my master's I studied how the brain integrate different senses such as proprioception and vision in stroke patients. I used computational models to describe 
          integration of these senses post stroke. After studying computational models of the brain, I realized how elegent the brain is at solving problems and how useful the models of the 
          brain are to advance our current knowledge in artificial intelligence. </h2>
