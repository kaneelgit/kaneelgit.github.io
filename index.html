            Hi! Thank you for visiting my website. My  
            name is Kaneel. I am a recent graduate with 
            a master's degree from the University of Delaware. I am originally from <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" target = "_blank"> Sri Lanka </a> and 
            currently I am living in Newark, Delaware. <br> <br>
            
            During my master's I studied how the brain integrate different senses such as proprioception and vision in stroke patients. I used computational models to describe 
            integration of these senses post-stroke. After studying computational models of the brain, I realized how elegent the brain is at solving problems and how useful the models of the 
            brain are to advance our current knowledge in artificial intelligence (AI). Moving forward, my goal is to learn more about the brain and use the knowledge to advance AI systems.
            For example, use human multisensory integration models to advance multisensory integration in AI systems. (i.e integration of vision and audition in artifical systems) 
            I am also very interested in applying AI and ML to solve problems in healthcare, autonomy, finance etc. Furthermore, 
            I also enjoy participating in data science competitions on Kaggle and work as a freelancer on Upwork to expand my knowledge. <br> <br> 
            
            Apart from AI and cognitive sciences, I enjoy reading & studying about financial markets, autonomous trading and value investing. During my free time, I like to workout, cycle and travel. 
            (I'd say out of the three I spent most of the time working out &#128513;) <br> <br> 
            
            Research Interests:  <br>
            Cognitive science, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Cognitive Neuroscience, Multisensory Integration, Medical Image Processing </h2>
